In JavaScript V1
If we want to use an external JAR we need to add it to auxiliary files in JS filter and use it as follows:

var assertion = Packages.com.philips.ibe.SamlAssertion.AssertionBuilder.doSAMLAssertion();

Where

com.philips.ibe.SamlAssertion is the package
AssertionBuilder is the class
doSAMLAssertion is the method to be called


To use the same in JavaScript V2:

Add the Class to rhapsody.properties

# Additional Java classes which are accessible from the JavaScript (v.2) filter. This property is dynamic. Changes to this property will be
# picked up without a restart of the Rhapsody Engine
dynamic.JavaScriptService.JavaAccess=com.philips.ibe.SamlAssertion.AssertionBuilder

Restart the service

Add the JAR to auxiliary file in the filter

Call the same method in the following way:

Import the class as Java.type
var javaImp=Java.type("com.philips.ibe.SamlAssertion.AssertionBuilder");
Call the mehtod with the instance of the class
var assertion=javaImp.doSAMLAssertion();

In JavaScript V1
If we want to use an external JAR we need to add it to auxiliary files in JS filter and use it as follows:

var assertion = Packages.com.philips.ibe.SamlAssertion.AssertionBuilder.doSAMLAssertion();

Where

com.philips.ibe.SamlAssertion is the package
AssertionBuilder is the class
doSAMLAssertion is the method to be called
